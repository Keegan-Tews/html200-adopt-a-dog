Intro to Testing:

The website was built in Firefox. As such that is Adopt A Dogs most stable browser. It was built using the graceful degradation method, utilizing media queries and min-max pixel measurements. The site was first built for screen 1200px and up. This website was based on a pdf mockup image. As both I and the website progressed it began to take shape and resemble the provided mockup pdf.


Testing:

System - Laptop:
Operating system - Windows 11:

	Media Queries:
		Small mobile screen size: 0px min - 480px max
		Large mobile screen size: 481px min - 768px max
		Tablet screen size: 769px min - 1024px max
		Desktop screen size: 1025px min - 1200px max
		Desktop Large screen size: 1201px min - 100% max - Added.

	Firefox: 
		Checked each link, button, hover state, and clickable to ensure functionality.

		Checked each media query set to ensure smooth and responsive transitioning between larger screens to smaller and back.
		

	Chrome: 
		Checked each link, button, hover state, and clickable to ensure functionality.

		On the home screen when the checkout link is pressed an alert saying $NaN that must be acknowledged before the checkout page loads. The way the total is 		tracked and handled is the cause of the alert. Unliked with Firefox which bypasses this alert, chrome does not allow the bypass.

		During testing I discovered an error with the grid when it was shrinking. The grid went from 4 to 3 to 1. 
		I edited the CSS to add a change from 3 to 2 and 2 to 1 when the grid is shrinking.
		
	Microsoft Edge:
		Checked each link, button, hover state, and clickable to ensure functionality.

		When checking the media queries, I discovered and error on the home page at 1201px to 1380px the grid and blog preview overlap.
		To fix this I introduced a new media query for 1201px and up.


System iPhone SE:
iOS Version 17.0.3

	Safari:
		Checked each link, button, hover state, and clickable to ensure functionality.
	
		Checked each media query set to ensure smooth and responsive transitioning between larger screens to smaller and back.

		When checking the checkout page I discovered that safari had a different default drop down selector. This caused the State selection portion of the page to 		look out of place and the zip code section that follows to be shifted out of place.
		Solution - N/A
